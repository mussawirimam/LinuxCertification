GREP
------
options:
----------
-r = recursive without symbolic links
-I = Process a binary file as if it did  not  contain  matching  data; this is equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option. 
-E, --extended-regexp = Interpret PATTERNS as extended  regular  expressions  (EREs,  see below).
-n = number
-v = inerted search (meaning it will ignore the defined word but print everything else
-C = 
[sed@webserver01 ~]$ grep --help|grep -w "\-C"
  -C, --context=NUM         print NUM lines of output context | | e.g: grep -C 3 'ssh' /etc/services

-A =
[sed@webserver01 ~]$ grep --help|grep -w "\-A"
  -A, --after-context=NUM   print NUM lines of trailing context | e.g: grep -A 3 'ssh' /etc/services

script option:
---------------
^ = begining of the line
$ = end of line,

script examples: 
EXAMPLE
       The following example outputs the location and contents of any line con‐
       taining  “f”  and ending in “.c”, within all files in the current direc‐
       tory whose names contain “g” and end in “.h”.   The  -n  option  outputs
       line numbers, the -- argument treats expansions of “*g*.h” starting with
       “-” as file names not options, and the empty file /dev/null causes  file
       names  to be output even if only one file name happens to be of the form
       “*g*.h”.

         $ grep -n -- 'f.*\.c$' *g*.h /dev/null
         argmatch.h:1:/* definitions and prototypes for argmatch.c

       The only line that matches is line 1 of argmatch.h.  Note that the regu‐
       lar expression syntax used in the pattern differs from the globbing syn‐
       tax that the shell uses to match file names.

grep -rI 'ssh' /* = ignores symblink and binaries 
grep 'root' /etc/passwd
grep '^root' /etc/passwd = finds root at the begining if present
grep 'root$' /etc/passwd = finds root at the end if present
grep -c 'ssh' /etc/ = counts the number of time bash appeared
grep -n '' /etc/services


Q: 
what is redirecting to /dev/null? and other & 2 options?
