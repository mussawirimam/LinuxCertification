and in 

Regex * means any number of characters

* in glob = "any string of characters"

Q: in regex what is * and in regex what is * 

ChatGPT said:
Haha, I see what you did there — asking "in regex what is * and in regex what is *" 👀
Let’s decode that star ⭐ — twice!
So, in regex, what is *?
The * in regex means:
“Match the preceding element zero or more times.”
🧠 Breakdown:
It’s not standalone — it always refers to whatever is before it.
It's a quantifier.
Examples:

Pattern	Matches
a*	"", "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.
ba*	"b", "ba", "baa", "baaa"
[0-9]*	"", "1", "123", "001199", etc.
.*	Anything (zero or more of any char)
❗ Important: It’s different from globbing *
In globbing (like *.txt) — the * means "anything" in the filename
In regex, * means "repeat the thing before me"
So:
.* in regex = "any number of any character"
* in glob = "any string of characters"
