Openssl 
How can I generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL?
Self-signed certificate
------------------------
# Interactive
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365

# Non-interactive and 10 years expiration
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/C=XX/ST=StateName/L=CityName/O=CompanyName/OU=CompanySectionName/CN=CommonNameOrHostname"

You can also add -nodes (short for "no DES") if you don't want to protect your private key with a passphrase. Otherwise, it will prompt you for "at least a 4 character" password.

The days parameter (365) you can replace with any number to affect the expiration date. It will then prompt you for things like "Country Name", but you can just hit Enter and accept the defaults.

Add -subj '/CN=localhost' to suppress questions about the contents of the certificate (replace localhost with your desired domain).

Self-signed certificates are not validated with any third party, unless you import them to the browsers previously. If you need more security, you should use a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA).




in organization:
----------------
"""
- you create the private key and the csr and get it approved/verified by the certificate authority
- you give the key and csr to public ca (certificate authority) and they provide you the pem files
