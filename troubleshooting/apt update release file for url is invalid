The error you're encountering usually happens when the system's clock is incorrect. The time on your system is out of sync with the server's timestamp, which is causing this error while trying to fetch updates. You can resolve this by correcting your system clock.

Here’s how to fix it:

1. Synchronize the System Clock
You can synchronize your system's clock using the ntp or chrony service, or using timedatectl if your distribution supports it.

Option 1: Using timedatectl (Preferred for modern Ubuntu)
To check and synchronize the time automatically, use the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
This will enable Network Time Protocol (NTP) to keep your system clock synchronized with internet time servers.

To check the current status of your time configuration:

bash
Copy
Edit
timedatectl status
Option 2: Install and Use ntp (Older systems)
If timedatectl isn't working or available, you can install ntp and let it manage the time synchronization.

Install the NTP service:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ntp
Start and enable the NTP service:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl enable ntp
sudo systemctl start ntp
Option 3: Manual Time Set (Quick Fix)
If you don’t want to set up NTP right now, you can manually set the time to resolve the issue temporarily.

Check the current time on your system:

bash
Copy
Edit
date
Set the correct time (you can modify the time and date below):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo date -s "21 FEB 2025 15:30:00"
2. Retry the Update
Once the time is synced, retry the update:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
This should resolve the error and allow you to fetch updates without issues.
